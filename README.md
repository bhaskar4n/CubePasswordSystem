CubePasswordSystem
==================

cube password system has cube like user interface to get the user password.

i created my own password system to save my data like passwords and other stuffs. i got this idea from the mathematical cube and the cube has six sides. so i implemented this idea to my password system. cube password system has six sides.each side has it own password. In cube password system to encrypt the data you must enter the password for each side of the cube to encrypt it. similarly to decrypt the data you must enter correct password for the each side of the cube. 


requirements:python version 2.7, wxpython version 2.7

#### note:
<ul>
<li>currently i have created four sides that works fine.</li> 
<li>i have implemented md5 encryption for passwords.</li>
<li>i have implemented bas64 encode system for data encryption.</li> 
<li>coding in progress for another two sides, encryption algorithms for data encryption and some additional features</li>
</ul>

 [ ] working 
  - [ ] another two sides
  - [ ] encryption algorithms
  - [ ] additional features



### some screen shots of cube password system UI
##### side 1 of the cps
In the first side i have entered three letters as a password in different boxes. Next time while retrieving the data you must enter the password in correct boxes.

following side2, side3, side4 are same like the side 1.
