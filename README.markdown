CubePasswordSystem
==================

cube password system has cube like user interface to get the user password.

i created my own password system to save my data like passwords and other stuffs. i got this idea from the mathematical cube and the cube has six sides. so i implemented this idea to my password system. cube password system has six sides.each side has it own password. In cube password system to encrypt the data you must enter the password for each side of the cube to encrypt it. similarly to decrypt the data you must enter correct password for the each side of the cube. 


requirements:
python version 2.7
wxpython 2.7

note: currently i have implemented four sides

coding in progress...
